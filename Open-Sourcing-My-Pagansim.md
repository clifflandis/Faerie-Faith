# Open Sourcing My Paganism, by Cliff Landis

In the middle of the night on 2023-08-10 I was visited by a muse[^muse].  The message I recieved from that muse was multilayered, but at its core the message was a command to "open source" (as a verb), my particular version of Paganism.  This informal personal essay is my attempt to do just that.

## My Background
In fall of 1998, while a freshman at Auburn University, I met my future teacher, Linda Kerr.  After spending several months asking to be trained in Linda's tradition, she relented and I began training as a neophyte in the Faerie Faith[^faeriefaith.net].  I continued to train over the next seven and a half years, culminating in my Fifth Solar degree as a High Priest of the Faerie Faith, with full authority to begin my own coven and to continue teaching the Faerie Faith tradition. 

During the course of my training, I also met Pat Zook, Linda's former teacher[^pat-obit].  Pat (known to the community as Lady Epona), had taken the rituals and lessons of Faerie Faith that had been given to her by Mark Roberts[^mark-obit], and delved deeper into their mysteries and the mysteries of the BLN Lunar Tree Calendar. She introduced new elements to the tradition (Bach flowers, an emphasis on ethics, an emphasis on personal growth and transformation, etc.) and had removed other elements she felt were no longer a fit. Linda, too, added elements to her version of the Faerie Faith (the student's journey through the Lunar Tree Calendar cycle, five solar degrees instead of three, etc.) and removed others (Wiccan elements, feminist elements, etc.).

In the years that followed my Fifth Solar passage ritual, I trained several students, but none of them completed the training.  Meanwhile, Pat's health began to decline, and when she was close to entering hospice care my family moved her in with us and we cared for her for the next three and a half years. During this time, Pat encouraged me to train several people she had talked to about Faerie Faith -- Pat was a charasmatic character, and so I began training five students in a coven the students named The Book Club, two of whom would continue on with me following Pat's death.  

However, Pat's hospice care was no cake walk.  Pat struggled with alcohol dependency, and she could be verbally hurtful, both intentionally and unintentionally. Like all the rest of us, she was a human being struggling with her own past trauma and found ways to cope.  Although Pat had introduced personal growth and transformation to Faerie Faith, I sometimes wonder if that was a case of "teaching that which we have to learn" -- providing for others the safe container to learn and grow that she never had.  Additionally, I was struggling with the ethics of some of the content that I was taught in the Faerie Faith (more on that later).  Regardless, the mental and emotional roller coaster I went through during this time left me with distaste and doubts, and so on 2018-02-20 I called an end to The Book Club and stepped back from Faerie Faith.

In the years that followed, I have wrestled with ideas and feelings about Faerie Faith and how to best present the tradition to potential students, and to the world as a whole.  But one of the ineffable mysteries of life is the gift of insight -- how a single moment of shifted perspective can instantaneously dissove a problem that was seen as utterly intractable just moments before.  What follows are some thoughts born from the insight provided by the muse.

## Growing Pains
Faerie Faith is at its core a growing and evolving tradition.  Something that was emphasized early on in my training is that it was important as a new student to learn "how things are done," but that once the student had developed a solid foundation in -- and respect for -- Faerie Faith's teachings, the student was exptected to continue to grow the tradition. 

One of Linda's other students, Imré, did this by digging into Faerie Faith's history.  

From the early twentieth century through the 1980s, the story of Paganism was dominated by a narrative that Pagan traditions (including Wicca) were either unbroken lineages dating back to ancient times, or at least pieces of ancient teachings that were cobbled together into new forms of Neopagansim.  However, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the expansion of the Internet made it possible to do new research and make new connections. Imré began researching into the history of the Faerie Faith in an attepmt to make contact with our "cousins" in the Faerie Faith (the McFarland Dianics of Texas), and to trace the roots of our lineage back as far as possible.  What Imré discovered, however, was that the story of Faerie Faith's history as it had been taught to us was not authentic, and that much of it had been pulled from other sources and misrepresented as a complete, ancient tradition. 

While this new information was a shock to those of us practicing Faerie Faith, it did not shake our foundations. After all, the tradition that Mark had given to Pat seemed somewhat different from the tradition that Linda had taught to me.  These new revalations also did nothing to discount the transformation, growth, and personal gnosis[^upg] that I had experienced as a student of the Faerie Faith.  

However, it did raise a question -- how do we talk to potential students, and the world at large, about our history?  If our history faced the same challenges of misappropriation and misrepresentation as the history of Wicca and Gerald Gardner, how were we to grapple with and communicate that fact? Read on.

### Appropriation
Another challenge that I grappled with was content in the Faerie Faith readings that pulled from pseudo-indigenous teachings. 

For example, one of the first books I was instructed to read as a Faerie Faith student was "The Secret Science Behind Miracles" by Max Freedom Long.[^tssbm]  Huna, the system created by Long, was presented as a Hawaiian/Polynesean system of philosophy, psychology, and magic. A main element of Huna was a view of the human psyche being made of three parts: High Self, Middle Self, and Low Self -- this parts language was used heavily throughout my Faerie Faith training as a way to help talk about the process of personal transformation and growth.  When Long published the book in 1948, he was able to borrow content from the New Thought and Theosophical movements, misuse some Hawaiian words, lie about the origins of the content, and get a publisher to print it all. 

In my own reserach into the background of Faerie Faith content, I read works that provided evidence that Long made the whole thing up.[^chai]  Additionally, I read writings by native Hawaiians who found Huna to be harmful to their own culture, identity, and traditions.[^hall][^lee]  And yet, I grappled with the fact that the content itself had been helpful enough to me during my own training, that I was hesitant to remove it wholesale.  How could I teach students a lie, especially one that harmed a living culture?  Read on.

Native American teachings and shamanism were also part of the content of Faerie Faith readings and practices.  As I continued to dig into the content, I looked for reviews of the works we were told to read.  Authors like Hyemeyohsts Storm, Carlos Castaneda, and Michael Harner were labeled as "plastic medicine men" and "plastic shamans" -- people with little to no native ancestry who were selling a mixture of traditional teachings and new age content.  Again, I read accounts of how these outside sources were actively causing harm to living, margainlized communities. Again, I had to grapple with how I had been positively impacted by some of the readings and exercises in these works, and yet again, how was I supposed to present this content in a way that reflected the strong ethical foundation that my teachers had passed on to me? Read on.

### A Changing World
There are elements to Faerie Faith that are pulled from other cultures that do not have the air of appropriation about them, such as Taoism. As a diverse tradition indigenous to China, Taoism values simplicity, living in harmony with nature, and not struggling against the contant flow of change.  Learning to relax one's grip on life's events and letting change and growth happen naturally are core insights that students in Faerie Faith gain from reflecting on Taoist content.  These teachings and mysteries are not cultural secrets, and students can trace the history of the content without discovering some white guy who stole native words or teachings to turn around and sell.

This acknowledgement of change is what enables Faerie Faith to respond to shifting cultural norms and values.  Twentieth century Paganism had a strong emphasis on male-female dualism and the reconstruction of heteronormative fertility religions, which often dismissed queer and trans people's experience (or just outright banned them from participating).[^trans]  But as the queer and trans liberation movements saw these communities gain more equal footing in society, these groups started speaking up about their lived experiences of rejection in the Pagan community.  I am lucky, however, to be able to state that the Faerie Faith I was taught always welcomed queer and trans people.  As a Dianic tradition, our own practice is heavily languaged toward the feminine and female experience, but as a gay man I rarely felt "othered" by my community.

Still, change is constant, and the emergence of non-binary and gender expansive identities forces us to look again at our practices and language.  How can Faerie Faith continue to be a welcoming space for confronting the difficult challenges of personal growth and transformation, regardless of gender, identify, or label?  How can we find a new place of balance as the global conversation continues to shift? Read on.

## Choosing Healthy Alternatives
In the last several years as I have grappled conciously and subconsiously with the above challenges, and I have kept my eyes and heart open to alternatives.  I was looking for content that could supplement, complement, or even completely replace portions of the Faerie Faith curriculum that I was no longer comfortable teaching while trying to maintain my own sense of integrity.  

In the case of Huna, I found that the most valuable component of the system -- the parts language (High, Middle, and Low selves) -- was easily replaced by the Internal Family Systems (IFS) Model developed by Richard C. Schwartz in the 1980s.  In the IFS model, the human psyche also consists of sub-personalities, or parts: 
* a "capital-S" Self (analogous with the High Self of Huna), which is the source of openness, love, curiosity, and compassion,
* a seat of consious awareness (analogous to the Middle Self of Huna), which is the source of in-the-moment thought, voice, consideration, and navigation, and
* many other semi-consious parts (analogous to the Low Self of Huna), which are the source of our feelings, memories, and reactions; many of these parts either hold onto trauma or try to protect the rest of the person's psyche from that trauma.

Having started IFS therapy several years ago, I was delighted to discover how the process of going into light trance to communicate with my parts came quite easily as a result of my previous reflection experineces with Huna in Faerie Faith.  Parts language has the added benefit of being part of our natural way of speaking in English:  it is not unusual to say, "Well, I'm conflicted because part of me feels like this, while another part of me feels like that."  Being able to use this way of speaking to develop more compassion for ourselves, while also striving for healthy change, is a necessity for the type of work that we do in Faerie Faith.  

As a result, I have replaced Huna with IFS in my own teaching of the Faerie Faith.  Yet how am I to honor Huna's historical role in Faerie Faith, my teachers' choices to include Huna when they did, and the positive impact of Huna on my own growth, while also acknowledging its problemmatic orgins and impact?  Read on.

Similarly, I sought out alternative sources on Native American studies and shamanism, trying to find something that was both genuine and not harmful to the communities is came from.  Alas, most of what I found was more plastic medicine men and plastic shamans.  So rather than endlessly searching for something that isn't there, I will point students to content that looks not only at the historical practices of indigenous peoples, but also how those practices have been appropriated, stolen, and adapted by outsiders.[^reading-list]  This will hopefully provide students with a broader perspective, so that they understand the implications and impact of proclaiming oneself to be practicing traditions from groups to which they don't belong (as I freely admit to doing in my own past, in a state of ignorance).

## Seeing from Multiple Perspectives
I also want to introduce systems theory and systems thinking to Faerie Faith, both as a way to better understand the mysteries of our tradition, but also as a way to place our tradition's own past actions and choices in a non-judgmental historical context.

Systems theory is the transdisciplary study of systems -- how many interrelated and interdependent parts can come together to create a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.  Systems are found everywhere, from our bodies (cells coming together to form tissues, tissues coming together to form organs, etc.), to our societies (individuals forming organizations, organizations forming coalitions, etc.), to Nature Herself (quarks forming atoms, atoms forming molecules, etc.; trees forming forests, forests forming biomes, etc.).  As we study systems, we learn how things change and stay the same, what forces (physical and social) can move a system in a particular direction, and how changing perspectives can reveal hidden rules and patterns in our world.

As a human relational example, one of my students was having trouble communicating with his parents.  He had undergone a lot of change and felt like they didn't understand him, didn't trust him, perhaps didn't even like him. Over the course of a long conversation, I asked questions about their relationship from a place of openness and curiosity.  Gradually, I started expressing curiosity about what his parents might be thinking and feeling -- the student had a lot of guesses, but wasn't 100% sure.  Toward the end of the conversation, I asked if he felt grateful toward his parents for all that they had done to support his recent life changes, and he responded that he was.  I then proposed an experiment: expressing gratitude.  I wondered out loud how his parents would react if he told them that he was thankful for all that they had done.  He said that he would try it.  When he returned at the next training weekend, he reported that they were surprised by his expression of gratitude, but that it seemed to "break the ice" that had formed between them, allowing them to resume their more open communication.

The personal growth and transformation that a student experiences while training in the Faerie Faith is never limited to the student alone -- each student walks through life with a multitude of relationships, having profound influences on those around them.  An acknowledgement of these relationships is why there is a need for strong ethics and communication skills in Faerie Faith.  Learning to think from a systems perspective gives the student the foresight to identify pitfalls, and the flexibility to handle missteps and impacts as they inevitably happen.

## Warts and All
Just so, it is with a systems perspective that we must look back at the historical content, context, and training methods of the Faerie Faith.  We must look back at our past, **not** to judge it harshly, but to understand our predecessors' behvior in context.  As the aphorism goes, "all behavior makes sense in context." If we don't understand the behavior, we're missing some context.

It would be a grave error to look back at previous generations of Pagan practitioners and judge them by today's standards.  There's no need to dig up old letters and "cancel" people for making statements in the 1970s that are no longer considered polite or acceptable today. Instead, we should look at historical practices and statements in the context in which they happened.  At the same time, we should acknowledge that our own time is now, and that we may need to change some things in order to stay relevant and useful to those seeking to learn and practice the Faerie Faith. 

An added benefit of viewing changing Pagan traditions from a systems perspective is the addition of grace and humility to the mix.  Students must learn that when you're growing, all beginnings are humble -- whether that's the individual beginning of the journey as a student, or the collecive beginning that is the origin of a Pagan tradition.  This can help foster the patience and determination necessary to continue the challenging path of self-growth and transformation.  It is also a helpful reminder that much of the "common sense" we have today will be judged very differently by future Pagans -- hopefully they will offer us the same grace we offer to our own ancestors.

## Open Source-ing
It is therefore my goal to "open source" my own Paganism -- to make much of the content that I write or compile freely available and transparent for others to use, adapt, and reuse.  Built off of the philosophies of the open source movement, several religious traditions have been "open sourced" and freely publishing their materials. However, I recognize that Faerie Faith is also an esoteric tradition and has secrets that I am not allowed to reveal -- therefore I must strike a careful balance between open source and closed source content as I continue this work.

Joanna Fitzpatrick gave an excellent presnetation on Open Source Witchcraft at the ______, outlining the benefits and challenges of doing open source Pagansim and witchcraft. 

One consideration when "moving" a tradition from closed source to open source is the loss of control.  If I publish it freely, what if someone misuses it or causes harm?  Well, I cannot control the actions of others, and I believe that the benefits of transparency outweigh the benefits of control in this circumstance.  Besides, the readings and materials are helpers along the way, but they are not the path itself.  The path is in one's personal experience of the mysteries, which happen as part of the relationship one builds with oneself, one's coven sisters, and Nature Herself. Experience is, after all, the greatest teacher.

One thing that I can not possibly open source is spiritual direction.  That is limited to the personal relationship developed in circle (coven work).

## Version-ing
However, it did raise a question -- how do we talk to potential students, and the world at large, about our history?  If our history faced the same challenges of misappropriation and misrepresentation as the history of Wicca and Gerald Gardner, how were we to grapple with and communicate that fact? Read on.

And yet, I grappled with the fact that the content itself had been helpful enough to me during my own training, that I was hesitant to remove it wholesale.  How could I teach students a lie, especially one that harmed a living culture?  Read on.

Versioning, also known as version control, is an element of software development where changes to files are tracked over time.
