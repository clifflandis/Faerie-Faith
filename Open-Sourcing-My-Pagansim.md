# Open Sourcing My Pagansim

In the middle of the night on ____ I was visited by a muse***.  The message I recieved from that muse was multilayered, but at its core the message was a command to "open source" (as a verb), my particular version of Paganism.  This informal personal essay is my attempt to do just that.

## My Background
In fall of 1998, while a freshman at Auburn University, I met my future teacher, Linda Kerr.  After spending a couple of months asking to be trained in Linda's tradition, she relented and I began training as a neophyte in the Faerie Faith.  I continued to train over the next seven and a half years, culminating in my Fifth Solar degree as a High Priest of the Faerie Faith, with full authority to begin my own coven and to continue teaching the Faerie Faith tradition. 

During the course of my training, I also met Pat, Linda's former teacher.  Pat (known to the community as Lady Epona), had taken the rituals and lessons of Faerie Faith that had been given to her, and delved deeper into their mysteries and the mysteries of the BLN Lunar Tree Calendar. SHe introduced new elements to the tradition (Bach flowers, an emphasis on ethics, an emphasis on personal growth and transformation, etc.) and had removed other elements she felt were no longer a fit (_______). Linda, too, added elements to her version of the Faerie Faith (the student's journey through the Lunar Tree Calendar cycle, _______) and removed others (Wiccan and feminist elements, ____).

In the years that followed my Fifth Solar passage ritual, I trained several students, but none of them completed the training.  Meanwhile, Pat's health began to decline, and when she was close to entering hospice care my family moved her in with us and we cared for her for the next three and a half years. During this time, Pat encouraged me to train several people she had talked to about Faerie Faith -- Pat was a charasmatic character, and so I began training five students in a coven the students named The Book Club, two of whom would continue on with me following Pat's death.  

However, Pat's hospice care was no cake walk.  Pat struggled with alcohol dependency, and she could be verbally hurtful, both intentionally and unintentionally. Like all the rest of us, she was a human being struggling with her own past trauma and found ways to cope.  Although Pat had introduced personal growth and transformation to Faerie Faith, I sometimes wonder if that was a case of "teaching that which we have to learn" -- providing for others the safe container to learn and grow that she never had.  Additionally, I was struggling with the ethics of some of the content that I was taught in the Faerie Faith.  Regardless, the intellectual and emotional roller coaster I went through during this time left me with distaste and doubts, and so in _____ I called an end to The Book Club and stepped back from Faerie Faith.

In the years that followed, I have wrestled with ideas and feelings about Faerie Faith and how to best present it to potential students, and to the world as a whole.  But one of the ineffable mysteries of life is the gift of insight -- how a single moment of shifted perspective can instantaneously dissove a problem that was seen as utterly intractable just moments before.
