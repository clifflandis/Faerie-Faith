# Open Sourcing My Pagansim

In the middle of the night on ____ I was visited by a muse***.  The message I recieved from that muse was multilayered, but at its core the message was a command to "open source" (as a verb), my particular version of Paganism.  This informal personal essay is my attempt to do just that.

## My Background
In fall of 1998, while a freshman at Auburn University, I met my future teacher, Linda Kerr.  After spending a couple of months asking to be trained in Linda's tradition, she relented and I began training as a neophyte in the Faerie Faith.  I continued to train over the next seven and a half years, culminating in my Fifth Solar degree as a High Priest of the Faerie Faith, with full authority to begin my own coven and to continue teaching the Faerie Faith tradition. 

During the course of my training, I also met Pat, Linda's former teacher.  Pat (known to the community as Lady Epona), had taken the rituals and lessons of Faerie Faith that had been given to her by Mark Roberts, and delved deeper into their mysteries and the mysteries of the BLN Lunar Tree Calendar. She introduced new elements to the tradition (Bach flowers, an emphasis on ethics, an emphasis on personal growth and transformation, etc.) and had removed other elements she felt were no longer a fit (_______). Linda, too, added elements to her version of the Faerie Faith (the student's journey through the Lunar Tree Calendar cycle, _______) and removed others (Wiccan and feminist elements, ____).

In the years that followed my Fifth Solar passage ritual, I trained several students, but none of them completed the training.  Meanwhile, Pat's health began to decline, and when she was close to entering hospice care my family moved her in with us and we cared for her for the next three and a half years. During this time, Pat encouraged me to train several people she had talked to about Faerie Faith -- Pat was a charasmatic character, and so I began training five students in a coven the students named The Book Club, two of whom would continue on with me following Pat's death.  

However, Pat's hospice care was no cake walk.  Pat struggled with alcohol dependency, and she could be verbally hurtful, both intentionally and unintentionally. Like all the rest of us, she was a human being struggling with her own past trauma and found ways to cope.  Although Pat had introduced personal growth and transformation to Faerie Faith, I sometimes wonder if that was a case of "teaching that which we have to learn" -- providing for others the safe container to learn and grow that she never had.  Additionally, I was struggling with the ethics of some of the content that I was taught in the Faerie Faith.  Regardless, the intellectual and emotional roller coaster I went through during this time left me with distaste and doubts, and so in _____ I called an end to The Book Club and stepped back from Faerie Faith.

In the years that followed, I have wrestled with ideas and feelings about Faerie Faith and how to best present the tradition to potential students, and to the world as a whole.  But one of the ineffable mysteries of life is the gift of insight -- how a single moment of shifted perspective can instantaneously dissove a problem that was seen as utterly intractable just a moments before.  What follows are some thoughts born from the insight provided by the muse.

## Growing Pains
Faerie Faith is at its core a growing and evolving tradition.  Something that was emphasized early on in my training is that it was important as a new student to learn "how things are done," but that once the student had developed a solid foundation in and respect for Faerie Faith's teachings, the student was exptected to continue to grow the tradition. 

One of Linda's other students, Imre, did this by digging into Faerie Faith's history.  

From the early twentieth century through the 1980s, the story of Paganism was dominated by a narrative that Pagan traditions (including Wicca) were either unbroken lineages dating back to ancient times, or at least pieces of ancient teachings that were cobbled together into new forms of Neopagansim.  However, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the expansion of the Internet made it possible to do new research and make new connections. Imre began researching into the history of the Faerie Faith in an attepmt to make contact with our "cousins" in the Faerie Faith (the McFarland Dianics), and to trace the roots of our lineage back as far as possible.  What Imre discovered, however, was that the story of Faerie Faith's history as it had been taught to us was not authentic, and that much of it had been pulled from other sources and misrepresented as a complete, ancient tradition. 

While this new information was a shock to those of us practicing Faerie Faith, it did not shake our foundations. The tradition that Mark had given to Pat was somewhat removed from the living, vital tradition that Linda had taught to me.  These new revalations also did nothing to discount the transformation, growth, and personal gnosis that I had experienced as a student of the Faerie Faith.  

However, it did raise a question -- how do we talk to potential students, and the world at large, about our history?  If our history faced the same challenges of misappropriation and misrepresentation as the history of Wicca and Gerald Gardner, how were we to grapple with and communicate that fact? Read on.

### Appropriation
Another challenge that I grappled with was content in the Faerie Faith readings that pulled from pseudo-indigenous teachings. 

For example, one of the first books I was instructed to read as a Faerie Faith student was "The Secret Science Behind Miracles" by Max Freedom Long.  Huna, the system in that and other books by Long, was presented as a Hawaiian/Polynesean system of philosophy, psychology, and magic. A main element of Huna was a view of the human psyche being made of three parts: High Self, Middle Self, and Low Self -- parts languaged used heavily throughout my Faerie Faith training as a way to help with personal transformation and growth.  When Long wrote the books in the early 20th century, it was easy for him to create a body New Thought work with some Hawaiian words misused, lie about the origins of the content, and get a publisher to print his works. 

In my own reserach into the background of Faerie Faith content, I read works by _______ that provided evidence that Long likely made the whole thing up.  Additionally, I read writings by native Hawaiians who found Huna to be harmful to their own culture, identity and traditions.  And yet, I grappled with the fact that the content itself had been helpful enough to me during my own training, that I was hesitant to remove it wholesale.  How could I teach students a lie, especially one that harmed a living culture?  Read on.

Native American teachings and shamanism were also part of the content of Faerie Faith readings and practices.  As I continued to dig into the content, I looked for reviews of the works we were told to read.  Authors like Heythementos Storm and _____ were labeled as "plastic medicine men" and "plastic shamans" -- people with little to no native ancestry who were selling a mixture of traditional teachings and new age content.  Again, I read accounts of how these outside sources were actively causing harm to living, margainlized communities. Again, how was I supposed to present this content in a way that reflected the strong ethical foundtain that my teachers had passed on to me? Read on.

### A Changing World
There are elements to Faerie Faith that are pulled from other cultures that do not have the air of appropriation about them, such as Taoism. As a diverse tradition indigenous to China, Taoism values simplicity, living in harmony with nature, and not struggling against the contant flow of change.  Learning to relax one's grip on life's events and letting change and growth happen naturally are core insights that students in Faerie Faith gain from reflecting on Taoist content.  These teachings and mysteries are not cultural secrets, and students can trace the history of the content without discovering some white guy who stole native words or teachings to turn around and sell.

This acknowledgement of change is what enables Faerie Faith to respond to shifting cultural norms and values.  Twentieth century Paganism had a strong emphasis on male-female dualism and the reconstruction of heteronormative fertility religions, which often dismissed queer and trans people's experience (or just outright banned them from participating).  But as the queer and trans liberation movements saw these communities gain more equal footing in society, these groups started speaking up about their lived experiences of rejection in the Pagan community.  I am lucky, however, to be able to state that the Faerie Faith I was taught always welcomed queer and trans people.  As a Dianic tradition, our own practice is heavily languaged toward the feminine and female experience.  However, as a gay man I rarely felt "othered" by my community.

Still, change is constant, and the emergence of non-binary and gender expansive identities forces us to look again at our practices and language.  How can Faerie Faith continue to be a welcoming space for confronting the difficult challenges of personal growth and transformation, regardless of gender, identify, or label?  How can we find a new place of balance as the global conversation continues to shift? Read on.

## Choosing Healthy Alternatives
In the last several years as I have grappled conciously and subconsiously with the above challenges, and I have kept my eyes and heart open to alternatives.  I was looking for content that could supplement, complement, or even completely replace portions of the Faerie Faith curriculum that I was no longer comfortable teaching while trying to maintain my own sense of integrity.  

In the case of Huna, I found that the most valuable component of the system -- the parts language (High, Middle, and Low selves) -- was easily replaced by the Internal Family Systems (IFS) Model created by ________.  In the IFS model, the human psyche also consists of many sub-personalities, or parts: 
* a "capital-S" Self (analogous with the High Self of Huna), which is the source of openness, love, curiosity, and compassion,
* a seat of consious awareness (analogous to the Middle Self of Huna), which is the source of in-the-moment thought,  consideration, and navigation, and
* many other semi-consious parts (analogous to the Low Self of Huna), which are the source of our feelings, memories, and reactions, many of which either hold onto trauma or try to protect the rest of the person's psyche from that trauma.

Having now been in IFS therapy for over two years, I was delighted to discover how the process of going into light trance to communicate with my parts came quite easily as a result of my previous reflection experineces with Huna in Faerie Faith.  Parts language has the added benefit of being part of our natural way of speaking in English.  It is not unusual to say, "Well, I'm conflicted because part of me feels like this, while another part of me feels like that."  Being able to use this way of speaking to develop more compassion for ourselves, while also striving for healthy change, is a necessity for the type of work that we do in Faerie Faith.  

As a result, I have replaced Huna with IFS in my own teaching of the Faerie Faith.  Yet how am I to honor Huna's historical role in Faerie Faith, and the positive impact of Huna on my own growth, while also acknowledging its problemmatic orgins and impact?  Read on.

Similarly, I sought out alternative sources on Native American studies and shamanism, trying to find something that was both genuine and not harmful to the communities is came from.  Alas, most of what I found was more plastic medicine men and plastic shamanism.  So rather than endlessly searching
