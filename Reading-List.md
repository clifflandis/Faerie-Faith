# Faerie Faith Reading List

Many of the books listed here are required reading for those on the path of the Faerie Faith. Even if you're not studying with us, you can still gain insights from the books below. We tend to focus heavily on psychology and mythology, while staying away from modern-day "pop" psychology, and recommend very few or no books on ritual, tarot, magick, or other standard Pagan or Wiccan books. Some of the books listed here are fairly heavy reading, and some may seem to have absolutely nothing to do with studying the Craft. But they are all necessary to a well-rounded education. However, some of the books may be hard to find or out of print; many were written around the turn of the century. Good luck!
